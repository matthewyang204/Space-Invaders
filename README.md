# Space Invaders
A modern edition of what is recognized as the world's first shoot 'em up game. This edition is made with Scratch and Electron.

Requirements:

At least 4 GB of RAM

Windows (Intel): 64-bit processor, 10 or later

Windows (ARM): Windows 11 or later

macOS: macOS 11 or later (OpenCore Legacy-patched Macs will work fine)

Linux: 64-bit Intel processor

Usage instructions:

macOS:
1. Downloads the disk image/ZIP archive that has macOS in its name
2. Unzip if it's a zip archive, open disk image if disk image
3. Move app to Applications folder

Note: If it gives you the malware warning message when opening the app run the following to disable gatekeeper's warnings:
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
The problem with macOS is that gatekeeper warns about apps that are unsigned, saying they "contain malware, and that you should move them to the trash". However, it also does this on all unsigned apps, safe app or not.

Windows:

1. Download the ZIP archive from the Release you want to use.
2. Copy the folder in the ZIP archive called "Windows" to your program files folder.
3. Rename the folder to "Space Invaders".

Linux: I haven't used Linux much and do not know how to use it. I just provided the ZIP for anyone here who knows how to.

ChromeOS:

1. Download the .html.zip file from the Release you want to use.
2. Decompress it to anywhere you want on your local drive.
3. Open it.

To update: There are no settings to lose, so just follow the installation instructions above to install a newer release.
