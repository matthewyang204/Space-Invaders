# Space Invaders
A modern edition of what is recognized as the world's first shoot 'em up game. This edition is made with Scratch and Electron.

Requirements:

At least 4 GB of RAM

Windows (Intel): 64-bit processor, 10 or later

Windows (ARM): Windows 11 or later

macOS: macOS 11 or later (OpenCore Legacy-patched Macs will work fine)

Linux: 64-bit Intel processor

Usage instructions:

macOS:
1. Downloads the disk image/ZIP archive that has macOS in its name
2. Unzip if it's a zip archive, open disk image if disk image
3. Move app to Applications folder

Note: If it gives you the malware warning message when opening the app run the following to disable gatekeeper's warnings:
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
The problem with macOS is that gatekeeper warns about apps that are unsigned, saying they "contain malware, and that you should move them to the trash". However, it also does this on all unsigned apps, safe app or not.

Windows:

1. Download the ZIP archive from the Release you want to use.
2. Copy the folder in the ZIP archive called "Windows" to your program files folder.
3. Rename the folder to "Space Invaders".
4. Move it to your Program Files folder

Linux:
1. Download the ZIP archive
2. Unzip it
3. Put it wherever you'd like
4. Run start.sh in a new terminal

ChromeOS:

1. Download the .html and put it wherever you want on your chromebook's local storage.
2. Open it.

To update: There are no settings to lose, so just follow the installation instructions above to install a newer release.
